What is this for? What does it mean, why is it like that, where is it,
who is he?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A question: how many planets are there in the solar system?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Between 1930, the year of Pluto’s discovery by the American Clyde Tombaugh,
and 2006, there were nine planets.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
From the closest to the Sun to the farthest: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto. But in 2006 another American,
Mike Brown,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
nicknamed “Pluto Killer,” showed that Pluto is not a planet like the others.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Why? Because it is too small and not unique, similar to many objects
in the region of Neptune, such as

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Eris, discovered by him in 2006. Pluto then became a dwarf planet,
and this discovery reduced the number of true planets to 8.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Finally, until January 20, 2016, when Mike Brown again, with Konstantin Batygin,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
working together, claimed to have discovered by calculation a 9th planet.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
According to the two astronomers, only the presence of a planet ten times
heavier than Earth

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
can explain why some dwarf planets do not orbit correctly.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Indeed, like a shepherd, a ninth planet would gather its flock of dwarf planets

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
in a single direction. Very far from the Sun, it would take 10,000 to

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
20,000 years to complete one orbit. No giant telescope has yet observed it

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
to provide ultimate proof of its existence. Brown and Batygin gave themselves

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
five years to succeed. In short, today there are 8 observable planets
and one

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
9th inferred by calculation, until the next discovery.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
